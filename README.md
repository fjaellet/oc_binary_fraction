# The binary fraction in open clusters with Gaia

This repository contains the complementary code for [Donada et al. (2023)](arXiv link here).

The notebooks are structured as follows:

* [compute_binaryfraction.ipynb](compute_binaryfraction.ipynb): Demonstrates how to run our mixture model with emcee on the Gaia colour-magnitude diagrams of open-cluster main sequences. Can be used to reproduce Figs. 3 and 4 in our paper. 
* [binary_fraction_analysis.ipynb](binary_fraction_analysis.ipynb): Reproduces most of the analysis figures in our paper (Figs. 1, 6, 7, 10-14)
* [literature_comparison.ipynb](literature_comparison.ipynb): Comparison to some results from the literature. Reproduces Fig. 9 in our paper.
